//! A memory-optimized, zero-copy account representation for Solana.
//!
//! This module provides `AccountSharedData`, an enum that manages Solana accounts either
//! in a memory-mapped region (`AccountBorrowed`) or on the heap (`AccountOwned`). The primary
//! goal is to maximize performance by directly manipulating account data in memory-mapped
//! files, avoiding deserialization overhead.
//!
//! ## Core Concepts
//!
//! - **`AccountBorrowed`**: A lightweight view into an account's data stored in a memory-mapped
//!   file. It uses raw pointers for direct field access and modification. This is the "zero-copy"
//!   part of the implementation.
//!
//! - **Copy-on-Write (CoW)**: To handle modifications safely (e.g., during a transaction that
//!   might fail), `AccountBorrowed` uses a shadow buffer. The first time a borrowed account is
//!   modified, its data is copied to an adjacent "shadow" memory region. All subsequent changes
//!   are applied to this shadow copy.
//!
//! - **`ShadowSwitch`**: An atomic counter that acts as a sequence lock. It tracks which buffer
//!   (primary or shadow) holds the most recent version of the account data. An even count
//!   points to the primary buffer, and an odd count points to the shadow buffer. This allows for
//!   safe, optimistic reads.
//!
//! - **`AccountOwned`**: A standard, heap-allocated representation of an account.
//!   An `AccountBorrowed` is promoted to `AccountOwned` if its data needs to grow
//!   beyond the capacity of its memory-mapped buffer.
//!
//! ## Memory Layout
//!
//! The efficiency of this module hinges on a precise and stable memory layout for serialized
//! accounts. Each account record consists of a small header, a primary data buffer, and an
//! identical shadow buffer for CoW operations.
